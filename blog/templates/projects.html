    <h3>Google App Engine Imageboard</h3>
    <p>This site is an imageboard where users may upload and share images with one another. This site was built with Python and Google App Engine. The data is stored using Google Storage Engine, a NoSQL database. I used Jinja2 for the templating on this site.</p>

    <h3>Blog</h3>
    <p>This very website runs on Django, and was one of my earliest adventures into Python's web development ecosystem. Django provides a very nice MVC architecture, which helped to modularly and quickly prototype my site. I use a third party application to handle metatags called <i>Taggit</i>.

    <h3>Rotation Encryption</h3>
    <p>This script was a learning experience on data types and object-oriented programming in Python. I made a first version and then revised it about a month later, incorporating my own feedback into the revision. Text is entered, broken into 8 character chunks, and transformed to a multidimensional list of the ASCII binary values of each character. The multidimensional list is viewed as a square; the output is an interpretation of that same square rotated by 90 degrees. The lists are then concatenated, regrouped, and packaged back into 8 character chunks, giving an encrypted version of the original text.</p>
